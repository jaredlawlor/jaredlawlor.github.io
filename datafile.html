  <h3>Here is a graphic that shows a ranking of the total number
    of days various houseguests have spent
     inside the Big Brother house, including international versions</h3>
    <p>Because Big Brother players are cut off from the outside world,
      they do not have access to social media, news, or even their
      families. I find this chart interesting, because it shows which houseguests
      from across the world have spent the most time within their respective
      Big Brother house. As you can see, <strong> Janelle </strong> has spent
      a combined 200 days inside the US house. Her record has recently been overtaken
      by Nicole Franzel. Janelle's time on BB is divided into the four separate
      years when she played: 2005, 2006, 2012, and 2020. She is quite the legend.</p>
